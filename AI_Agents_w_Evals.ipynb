            "    *   The response claims \"Both orders have been updated to 'Shipped' status\" and \"The inventory has been automatically adjusted\". The RAG learning states that for newly created orders, shipping is conditional on inventory. While this request is about existing orders, the principle of requiring inventory to ship is fundamental. The assistant implies this check was done and was successful. However, if the quantity for O3 is hallucinated, then any action taken on O3 (like shipping 25 units and adjusting inventory) would also be based on incorrect data, making the claimed actions inaccurate.\n",
